# BP Authoring Job Contract Policy

This policy defines the Section 12 through Section 58 contract between a
planner verdict and live Blueprint authoring execution.

## Required Manifest Fields

Every user request must be converted into a structured manifest with:

- original request text
- planner verdict and matched rules
- target Blueprint kind
- parent class
- parent class executable allowlist contract
- component list
- component default contracts
- component hierarchy contracts
- component property contracts
- variables and defaults
- event graph steps
- function graph steps
- function call contracts
- graph layout contracts
- graph layout spacing contracts
- generated function invocation steps
- dispatcher lifecycle steps
- validation plan
- structural validation plan
- cleanup and rollback boundary
- temporary smoke executor contract
- durable authoring executor contract
- durable preflight dry-run contract
- durable authoring enable contract
- durable canary preparation contract
- durable canary approval gate contract
- durable canary live preflight contract
- durable canary recovery matrix contract
- blocked or review reasons

## Execution Rule

Only `safe_to_author` planner results may become executable job manifests.
`requires_review` and `blocked_until_reinforced` requests are dry-run manifests
with no authoring commands and `authoring_attempted=false`.

Section 13 adds an additional executable-template guard: a planner-safe request
is still dry-run if the job contract cannot build concrete component, variable,
graph, function-call, dispatcher, and validation steps for it. This prevents
planner-safe but executor-unsupported requests from reaching live authoring.

Section 14 extends the executable manifest surface from event-graph function
calls into actual function graph authoring. This scope is deliberately narrow:
function graph creation, explicit input/output parameters, a return node, return
pin defaults, function graph node re-read, and compile validation.

Section 15 extends the function graph template into a constrained function body:
one local variable declaration, one local variable getter, one Kismet math node,
one input default for that math node, and explicit data-pin connections into the
return node. This is still template-driven authoring, not arbitrary C++ or user
logic lowering.

Section 16 adds structural postconditions. A safe manifest must not only compile;
it must also verify the expected graph, nodes, pin defaults, and pin links from
the manifest after live authoring has run.

Section 17 adds generated function invocation. A generated function graph may be
compiled into the temporary Blueprint generated class, then called from the Event
Graph through `add_blueprint_call_function_node` using the generated class path.

Section 18 adds generated function output consumption. A generated function call
is no longer considered complete just because its output pin exists; the manifest
must route the output into an explicit downstream Event Graph consumer.

Section 19 adds function-graph local variable set authoring. A function body may
now calculate a value, set a function-local variable, and return the set value
through an explicit exec/data chain.

Section 20 adds function-graph compare/branch body authoring. A function body
may now compare a function input, branch on the boolean result, set the same
function-local variable from then/else paths, and return the post-branch value
through one return node.

Section 21 adds structured failure diagnostics. A failed manifest step or
structural validation assertion must report the failing phase, section, step,
command, graph selector, node references, available node cache, recent bridge
stage tail, and error text.

Section 22 adds typed member-variable defaults. Safe manifests may now author
and validate bool, string, and vector member variable defaults through the
Blueprint generated class default object.

Section 23 adds an explicit function-call contract layer. Safe manifests now
record every authored call node as contract data before execution, including the
source step, target function identity, input defaults, required output pins, and
declared incoming/outgoing links. The live smoke executor validates this
contract from the authored node cache after graph creation; the contract itself
does not add authoring commands.

Section 24 adds graph layout diagnostics. Safe manifests now record the expected
`node_position` for each authored node that declares one, and the live smoke
executor validates the authored node's actual `x/y` coordinates from
`list_blueprint_nodes` against that manifest contract.

Section 25 closes the current control-flow MVP endpoint. Safe manifests may now
author a constrained Event Graph Sequence fan-out from BeginPlay into two
PrintString calls, with output-count, function-call, exec-link, and layout
postconditions.

Section 26 adds component default introspection. Safe manifests now validate
Blueprint SimpleConstructionScript component templates through the read-only
`list_blueprint_components` command, including component class, relative
transform defaults, and authored StaticMesh defaults.

Section 27 adds layout spacing diagnostics. Safe manifests now derive
`graph_layout_spacing_contracts` from explicit node-position contracts and the
live smoke executor asserts that authored nodes in the same graph are not placed
at near-identical coordinates.

Section 28 adds component hierarchy contracts. Safe manifests may now create a
SceneComponent root plus child SceneComponent-derived component, pass
`parent_component_name` through `add_component_to_blueprint`, and validate the
reported SCS parent relationship through `list_blueprint_components`.

Section 29 adds component property introspection. Safe manifests may now author
allowlisted component property defaults and validate them through the read-only
`get_component_property` command before treating the temporary Blueprint as
passed.

Section 30 adds the component property allowlist boundary. Planner-safe
component property requests remain non-executable unless the requested property
is present in the Section 30 allowlist and has an introspection-backed
postcondition.

Section 31 adds the parent class allowlist boundary. Planner-safe Blueprint
shell requests remain non-executable unless the requested parent class and
Blueprint kind are present in the Section 31 executable allowlist and have
parent-specific live smoke coverage.

Section 32 narrows temporary live-smoke persistence. Planner-driven temporary
Blueprint manifests must compile and validate, but they must not save the
temporary asset during smoke execution because the asset is deleted immediately
after validation. This keeps rollback limited to in-memory/editor temporary
state plus generated `_MCP_Temp` cleanup.

Section 33 separates temporary smoke execution from durable Blueprint authoring.
Planner-safe requests that ask for a saved, durable, or permanent Blueprint
asset remain non-executable until a dedicated durable executor exists with
target package preflight, save gate, overwrite or rename policy, and rollback
boundary. The live smoke remains temporary-only.

Section 34 adds a dry-run durable preflight contract. Durable requests still do
not execute, but the manifest now records the parsed target package path,
Blueprint name, target asset path, package allowlist result, required asset
existence check, overwrite or rename decision state, save gate state, and
`preflight_pass=false`. This gives future durable authoring a structured
preflight input without allowing a live save.

Section 35 allows the planner-driven live smoke to perform a read-only durable
asset existence check for prevented durable requests. The check uses
`unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.does_asset_exist` against the manifest target asset
path, records a `section_35_durable_preflight_live_result_v1`, and still keeps
`authoring_attempted=false`, `save_or_delete_attempted=false`, and
`preflight_pass=false`.

Section 36 adds a durable overwrite/rename decision contract. Durable requests
now classify conflict resolution as `missing`, `overwrite_existing`,
`rename_if_exists`, or `conflicting_decisions`. The decision is recorded for a
future durable executor, but `overwrite_allowed=false`,
`rename_if_exists_allowed=false`, and `executor_may_resolve_conflict=false`
until save and rollback policy exists.

Section 37 adds dry-run durable save gate and rollback policy contracts. Durable
requests now record why `save_allowed=false`, including disabled durable
executor, missing asset-exists result in the manifest, missing/conflicting
overwrite-rename decision, rollback policy not ready, and durable compile-save
validation not enabled. Rollback policy remains draft-only and protects
preexisting assets from delete or overwrite.

Section 38 adds a durable executor enablement readiness checklist. Durable
requests now record `durable_executor_ready=false` until all required checks
pass, including promoted live asset-exists result, conflict-resolution decision,
save gate, rollback policy, compile-save validation, executor-created asset
marker policy, and explicit durable executor enable flag.

Section 39 adds a disabled durable executor skeleton. Durable requests now
record the future executor shape, required input contracts, planned output
fields, forbidden commands, and disabled reasons. The skeleton has
`executor_enabled=false`, `can_execute=false`, `command_plan=[]`, and
`allowed_live_command_count=0`.

Section 51 adds a durable authoring enable contract. Durable requests now
separate target package allowlist, overwrite-or-rename decision, rollback
readiness, and executor-created ownership marker gates. The contract reports
`enable_contract_satisfied=false`, `durable_executor_may_open=false`, and keeps
`save=true`, `save_asset`, `delete_asset`, and `rename_asset` forbidden.

Section 52 adds a durable ownership marker contract. Durable requests now define
the marker a future executor must record before rollback/delete can be
considered. The marker policy may be ready while rollback remains disabled:
`delete_without_marker_allowed=false`, `delete_preexisting_asset_allowed=false`,
and `rollback_policy_ready=false`.

Section 53 adds a durable executor dry-run plan. Durable requests may now carry
a report-only plan for preflight, conflict policy, ownership marker, compile
validation, save gate, and rollback authorization. The plan has
`execution_command_plan=[]`, `live_command_count=0`, and
`durable_executor_may_execute=false`.

Section 54 adds a durable save validation simulator. Durable requests may now
evaluate save prerequisites in a report-only contract, but the simulator keeps
`save_true_allowed=false`, `save_asset_allowed=false`,
`compile_save_command_allowed=false`, and `live_command_count=0`.

Section 55 adds a durable canary preparation contract. Durable requests may now
reserve a canary target under `/Game/_MCP_Temp/DurableCanary`, but the prep
contract keeps `canary_live_execution_allowed=false`,
`general_blueprints_package_allowed=false`, `save_true_allowed=false`,
`save_asset_allowed=false`, and `delete_asset_allowed=false`.

Section 56 adds a durable canary approval gate. Durable requests may now carry
an explicit approval record scoped to the Section 55 canary asset, but the gate
keeps `canary_executor_may_open=false`,
`canary_live_execution_allowed=false`, `save_true_allowed=false`,
`save_asset_allowed=false`, `delete_asset_allowed=false`, and
`live_command_count=0`.

Section 57 adds a durable canary live preflight contract. Durable requests may
now allow a read-only canary `does_asset_exist` check, but the contract keeps
`canary_execution_allowed_after_preflight=false`,
`authoring_command_allowed=false`, `save_or_delete_allowed=false`,
`cleanup_command_allowed=false`, and all live author/save/delete/cleanup command
counts at `0`.

Section 58 adds a durable canary recovery matrix. Durable requests may now
record report-only rollback/cleanup scenarios, but the matrix keeps
`cleanup_command_allowed=false`, `delete_command_allowed=false`,
`save_command_allowed=false`, `authoring_command_allowed=false`, and all live
cleanup/delete/save/authoring command counts at `0`.

## Section 13 Executable Templates

The current executable manifest templates cover:

- Actor Blueprint shell creation with explicit allowlisted parent class.
- Static Mesh Component creation with optional Engine cube mesh default.
- Explicit `Health` int and `Speed` float variable defaults.
- BeginPlay to Branch event graph topology with stable node positions.
- Validated `KismetSystemLibrary.PrintString` event graph function call with
  explicit pin defaults.
- Blueprint Event Dispatcher declaration, call, bind, assign, unbind, clear,
  and delegate pin assertions.

## Section 14 Function Graph Template

The current function graph template covers:

- `resolve_blueprint_graph` with `graph_type="function"` and
  `create_if_missing=true`.
- Explicit integer input parameter `InputValue` with default `3`.
- Explicit integer output parameter `ResultValue` with default `7`.
- `add_blueprint_return_node` in the function graph.
- Return pin default assignment on `ResultValue`.
- `list_blueprint_nodes` for the named function graph before final compile.

The template does not yet cover arbitrary function body math, local variable
dataflow, branch/loop bodies inside function graphs, latent function graphs, or
calling the generated function from another graph.

## Section 15 Function Body Template

The current function body template covers:

- `resolve_blueprint_graph` with `graph_type="function"` and
  `create_if_missing=true`.
- Explicit `ResultValue` double output parameter.
- Function-scoped `LocalValue` double local variable with default `5.0`.
- `add_blueprint_variable_get_node` for `LocalValue` in that function graph.
- `add_blueprint_math_node` with `operation="add"`.
- `set_blueprint_pin_default` on the math node `B` input with value `2.0`.
- Data-pin connection from `LocalValue` to math input `A`.
- Data-pin connection from math `ReturnValue` to return `ResultValue`.
- Function graph node re-read and final compile validation.

The template does not yet cover local variable set nodes, arbitrary math
operator typing, generated function calls from another graph, branch/loop bodies
inside function graphs, latent function graphs, or graph layout diagnostics
beyond stable node positions.

## Section 16 Structural Validation Template

Executable manifests now include a `structural_validation_plan` with
postconditions derived from executable event/function/dispatcher steps:

- `assert_graph_resolved` for explicitly resolved function graphs.
- `assert_node_exists` for node-authoring commands that return node IDs.
- `assert_pin_default` for manifest pin default assignments.
- `assert_pin_link` for manifest data and exec pin connections.
- `assert_pin` for dispatcher lifecycle pin presence or absence checks.

Structural validation runs after the normal graph/node re-read and compile
validation steps have populated the executor's node result cache. Review and
blocked manifests do not include structural postconditions.

For `safe_function_graph_body_math`, the required structural checks include:

- `ComputePlannerBody` function graph resolved.
- `LocalValue` getter node exists.
- `add` math node exists.
- Math node `B` input default equals `2.0`.
- `LocalValue` output links to math input `A`.
- Math node `ReturnValue` links to return node `ResultValue`.

## Section 17 Generated Function Invocation Template

The generated invocation template covers:

- `ComputePlannerInvocation` function graph creation.
- Explicit `AddendValue` double input parameter with default `2.0`.
- Explicit `ResultValue` double output parameter.
- Function-scoped `LocalValue` double local variable with default `5.0`.
- Function body dataflow from `LocalValue` and `AddendValue` into an `add` math
  node, then into return `ResultValue`.
- A pre-invocation compile validation pass so the generated function is
  available on the Blueprint generated class.
- Event Graph `add_blueprint_call_function_node` using
  `{temp_package_path}/{blueprint_name}.{blueprint_name}_C`.
- Call input default verification for `AddendValue=2.0`.
- Call output pin presence verification for `ResultValue`.
- Event Graph exec connection from the existing safe BeginPlay/Branch path to
  the generated function call node.

## Section 18 Generated Function Output Consumption Template

The generated output-consumption template covers:

- Explicit member variable `LastInvocationResult` of type `double` with default
  `0.0`.
- Event Graph `add_blueprint_self_reference` node for member-variable target
  resolution.
- Event Graph `add_blueprint_variable_set_node` for `LastInvocationResult`.
- Exec connection from the generated function call node to the variable set node.
- Data-pin connection from generated function call output `ResultValue` to the
  variable set input `LastInvocationResult`.
- Data-pin connection from self reference output `self` to the variable set
  target input.
- Structural validation for the self node, set node, and all output-consumption
  links.

This section still does not cover generated function calls between separate
Blueprint assets, automatic non-self target object resolution, multiple output
consumers, implicit type conversion, latent generated functions, or graph layout
diagnostics beyond stable positions.

## Section 19 Function Graph Local Set Template

The local-set function body template covers:

- `ComputePlannerLocalSet` function graph creation.
- Explicit `InputValue` double input parameter with default `3.0`.
- Explicit `ResultValue` double output parameter with default `0.0`.
- Function-scoped `AccumulatedValue` double local variable with default `0.0`.
- Pre-set compile validation pass so the local variable is visible to variable set
  node authoring.
- `add_blueprint_math_node` with `operation="add"` and `B=2.0`.
- Data-pin connection from function entry `InputValue` to math input `A`.
- `add_blueprint_variable_set_node` for local variable `AccumulatedValue`.
- Data-pin connection from math `ReturnValue` to set input `AccumulatedValue`.
- Exec link replacement from the automatically generated entry-to-return chain
  into entry -> set -> return.
- Data-pin connection from set node `Output_Get` to return `ResultValue`.
- Structural validation for graph, entry/return/math/set nodes, pin default,
  exec links, and data links.

This section still does not cover multiple local set branches, local variable
get-after-set chains outside the single local-set template, loops, arrays,
implicit type conversion, latent function graphs, or graph layout diagnostics
beyond stable positions.

## Section 20 Function Graph Compare Branch Template

The compare/branch function body template covers:

- `ComputePlannerBranch` function graph creation.
- Explicit `InputValue` double input parameter with default `3.0`.
- Explicit `ResultValue` double output parameter with default `0.0`.
- Function-scoped `BranchResult` double local variable with default `0.0`.
- Pre-branch compile validation pass so the local variable is visible to local set
  node authoring.
- `add_blueprint_compare_node` with `operation="greater"`,
  `value_type="double"`, and threshold pin `B=10.0`.
- `add_blueprint_branch_node` in the function graph.
- Data-pin connection from function entry `InputValue` to compare input `A`.
- Data-pin connection from compare `ReturnValue` to branch `Condition`.
- Exec link replacement from the automatically generated entry-to-return chain
  into entry -> branch.
- Branch output pins use UnrealMCP's actual `then` and `else` pin names.
- Then and else paths each create a local `BranchResult` set node, with values
  `1.0` and `-1.0`.
- Both set-node exec outputs converge into the same function return node.
- A local `BranchResult` get node feeds return `ResultValue`.
- Structural validation for graph, entry/return/compare/branch/set/get nodes,
  pin defaults, branch exec links, and return dataflow.

This section still does not cover nested branches, loops, arrays, select nodes,
implicit type conversion, branch layout diagnostics, latent function graphs, or
arbitrary user logic lowering.

## Section 21 Failure Diagnostics Contract

Executable manifests now include `failure_diagnostics_contract` with diagnostic
schema `section_21_failure_diagnostics_v1`.

If a live manifest step fails, the planner-driven smoke report must include:

- manifest id and manifest version
- generated Blueprint name and temp package path
- failure phase: `manifest_step` or `structural_validation`
- manifest section name
- manifest step id
- operation and command
- graph name and graph type selectors
- referenced node keys such as `node_ref`, `source_node_ref`, `target_node_ref`,
  or `graph_ref`
- available node result refs from the executor cache
- compact node cache summary for referenced refs
- bridge stage tail with recent command/status pairs
- error type and error text

This contract is intentionally diagnostic-only. It does not weaken the safe
manifest gate, does not retry failed authoring, and does not keep temporary
assets unless the caller explicitly uses the keep-assets flag.

## Section 22 Typed Defaults Template

The typed-defaults template covers:

- Actor Blueprint shell creation.
- Scene Component authoring with an explicit transform default in the manifest.
- `bPlannerEnabled` bool variable with default `true`.
- `PlannerLabel` string variable with default `Section22`.
- `PlannerOffset` vector variable with default `[10, 20, 30]`.
- Optional variable metadata forwarding for exposed state, tooltip, friendly
  name, type object, array flag, and metadata map.
- Post-compile `assert_variable_default` validation that reads the generated
  class default object and compares the authored CDO value against the manifest
  default.

This section validates typed member variable defaults. Component transform
postconditions are handled by the Section 26 component default introspection
contract.

## Section 23 Function Call Contract Template

Executable manifests now include `function_call_contracts` with schema
`section_23_function_call_contract_v1` for supported call-node templates.

The current contract covers:

- Static reflected library calls such as `KismetSystemLibrary.PrintString`.
- Self-generated Blueprint function calls such as `ComputePlannerInvocation`.
- Source manifest section and source authoring step.
- Function class/path and function name requested by the manifest.
- Input pin defaults declared on the call node.
- Required output pins declared by follow-up assertions.
- Required incoming exec links into the call node.
- Required outgoing exec/data links from the call node into downstream
  consumers.
- Structural validation that the authored node is a `K2Node_CallFunction`, its
  visible node title matches the requested function name, declared defaults
  remain present, declared output pins exist, and declared links are present.

This section still does not cover calls to arbitrary object targets, cross-asset
target resolution, latent function calls, wildcard/array pin coercion, implicit
type conversion, overload disambiguation, or automatic selection among multiple
candidate UFunctions.

## Section 24 Graph Layout Diagnostics Template

Executable manifests now include `graph_layout_contracts` with schema
`section_24_graph_layout_contract_v1` for authored graph nodes that declare
`node_position`.

The current contract covers:

- Event Graph node positions for BeginPlay, Branch, PrintString, dispatcher
  lifecycle nodes, generated function call nodes, self references, and result
  sink set nodes.
- Function Graph node positions for getter, math, compare, branch, setter,
  return, and branch-result reader nodes where the template declares explicit
  `node_position`.
- Structural validation through `assert_node_layout`, comparing actual `x/y`
  from UnrealMCP node metadata against the manifest expected position with a
  16px tolerance for Unreal graph-node snap/title adjustments.
- Live diagnostics reporting `layout_assertion_count` per safe execution.

Section 27 extends these diagnostics with pairwise same-graph spacing checks.
This section currently validates node placement within a small fixed tolerance
and catches near-identical authored coordinates. It does not yet perform
automatic graph layout, node size-aware overlap detection, spline crossing
analysis, comment box grouping, or editor zoom/pan diagnostics.

## Section 25 Control-Flow MVP Template

The control-flow MVP template covers:

- Event Graph `ReceiveBeginPlay` entry.
- `add_blueprint_sequence_node` with `output_count=2`.
- Exec connection from BeginPlay to the Sequence node.
- Two static `KismetSystemLibrary.PrintString` calls, one for each Sequence
  output.
- Function-call contracts for both PrintString nodes.
- Structural validation that the Sequence node exists and exposes at least two
  output exec pins.
- Structural exec-link validation from `then_0` to the first PrintString call
  and from `then_1` to the second PrintString call.
- Layout validation for the BeginPlay, Sequence, and both PrintString nodes.

This is the current MVP endpoint for generic safe BP authoring: simple Actor
shells, components/defaults, simple component hierarchy attachment, allowlisted
component property defaults, typed variables, basic event graph glue, function
graphs with local math/set/branch bodies, generated self-function invocation,
dispatcher lifecycle nodes, function-call contracts, layout diagnostics, and a
minimal Sequence fan-out. More complex control flow such as loops, arrays,
switches, select nodes, latent nodes, async callback exec pins, GAS, replication,
and CommonUI remains blocked or review-only until separately reinforced.

## Section 26 Component Default Introspection Template

Executable manifests now include `component_default_contracts` with schema
`section_26_component_default_contract_v1`.

The current contract covers:

- Blueprint SCS component listing through `list_blueprint_components`.
- Component presence by manifest `component_name`.
- Component class matching against manifest `component_type`.
- Scene component `relative_transform.location`, `rotation`, and `scale`.
- Static mesh component `static_mesh` when a static mesh default was authored.
- Post-compile `assert_component_default` validation in the live smoke
  validation plan.

This closes the Section 22 deferral where SceneComponent transform defaults
were authored but not yet structural postconditions. The current implementation
still does not validate arbitrary component property types, attachment socket
metadata, inherited/native component defaults, or component hierarchy
reconstruction beyond parent component name reporting.

## Section 27 Layout Spacing Diagnostics Template

Executable manifests now include `graph_layout_spacing_contracts` with schema
`section_27_graph_layout_spacing_contract_v1`.

The current contract covers:

- Pairwise spacing contracts derived from authored nodes that already have
  `graph_layout_contracts`.
- Event Graph and Function Graph grouping using explicit `graph_type` when
  present, otherwise inferring `event` or `function` from the manifest section.
- Structural validation through `assert_layout_spacing`, comparing actual node
  `x/y` positions from UnrealMCP node metadata.
- A minimum Euclidean distance of `96.0` pixels between each pair of authored
  nodes in the same graph.
- Live diagnostics reporting `layout_spacing_assertion_count` per safe
  execution.

This prevents a false-safe where every individual node reports the expected
coordinate shape but two authored nodes accidentally share or nearly share the
same graph location. The current implementation is intentionally coordinate
based; it does not know exact Slate node dimensions and therefore reports
overlap risk rather than pixel-perfect visual overlap.

## Section 28 Component Hierarchy Contract Template

Executable manifests now include `component_hierarchy_contracts` with schema
`section_28_component_hierarchy_contract_v1`.

The current contract covers:

- A safe SceneComponent root plus child StaticMeshComponent manifest template.
- Optional `parent_component_name` on `add_component_to_blueprint`.
- UnrealMCP plugin-side validation that parent attachments only target existing
  SceneComponent SCS nodes and only attach SceneComponent-derived children.
- Post-authoring `assert_component_hierarchy` validation through
  `list_blueprint_components`.
- Parent declaration diagnostics through `parent_declared_in_manifest`.

This closes the Section 26 deferral where parent component names were reported
but not authored or validated by manifest-driven smoke. The current
implementation does not yet cover inherited/native parent attachment, sockets,
attachment rules, child promotion/reparenting, or arbitrary component tree
diffing.

## Section 29 Component Property Introspection Template

Executable manifests now include `component_property_contracts` with schema
`section_29_component_property_contract_v1`.

The current contract covers:

- A safe StaticMeshComponent `bVisible=false` property-default sample.
- `get_component_property` as a read-only UnrealMCP plugin command.
- Structured property serialization for bool, numeric, string, name, text,
  enum/byte enum, vector, rotator, object path, and export-text fallback values.
- Post-authoring `assert_component_property` validation in the live smoke.
- Capability-gate inclusion so component authoring requires both component
  listing and property introspection.

This closes the gap where `set_component_property` could author a value without
a manifest-level postcondition. The current implementation does not yet include
an arbitrary property allowlist, array/map/set property verification, object
reference resolution policy, or editor-display-name to C++ property-name
mapping.

## Section 30 Component Property Allowlist Template

Executable manifests now carry a `component_property_allowlist` policy record.

The current allowlist covers:

- `StaticMeshComponent.bVisible`
- value type: `bool`
- supported values: `true` and `false`
- postcondition: `get_component_property` plus `assert_component_property`

If a planner-safe request asks for an unlisted component property, such as
`CastShadow`, the job contract must keep the manifest non-executable and add a
`contract_unsupported_component_property` review reason. This prevents a
false-safe where broad planner language like "component property" routes into
arbitrary `set_component_property` execution without a type-aware contract.

Adding a new component property to the executable surface requires:

- adding it to the Section 30 allowlist
- proving `get_component_property` can serialize the property type
- adding an offline manifest test
- adding or updating a live smoke sample

## Section 31 Parent Class Allowlist Template

Executable manifests now carry a `parent_class_contract` policy record.

The current allowlist covers:

- Blueprint kind: `actor_blueprint`
- parent class: `Actor`
- live coverage: temporary Actor Blueprint shell authoring, component setup,
  graph authoring, compile validation, structural checks, and cleanup under
  `/Game/_MCP_Temp/PlannerDrivenSmoke`

If a planner-safe request asks for an unlisted parent class, such as
`Character`, the job contract must keep the manifest non-executable and add a
`contract_unsupported_parent_class` review reason. This prevents a false-safe
where broad planner language like "Blueprint shell" routes into a parent class
whose construction, inherited components, graph surface, or compile behavior has
not been validated.

Adding a new parent class to the executable surface requires:

- adding the parent class and Blueprint kind to the Section 31 allowlist
- proving parent-specific component, graph, compile, and cleanup behavior
- adding an offline manifest test
- adding or updating a live smoke sample

## Section 32 Temporary Smoke Save Boundary

Executable temporary smoke manifests call `compile_and_validate_blueprint` with
`save=false`.

The current boundary is:

- compile and refresh Blueprint nodes
- re-read authored graph, component, variable, and property state
- run structural postconditions
- inspect that the temporary asset exists in the editor/asset registry
- delete the generated temporary asset on success or failure

Temporary smoke manifests must not call `SaveLoadedAsset` as part of normal
validation. Save behavior can be reintroduced only for a durable authoring
executor that is not going to delete the generated asset and has its own save,
rollback, and editor-log diagnostics.

## Section 33 Durable Authoring Executor Boundary

Executable manifests now carry an `authoring_executor_contract` policy record
and a `durable_authoring_contract` policy record.

The current temporary smoke executor boundary is:

- live executor: `temporary_smoke`
- package root: `/Game/_MCP_Temp/PlannerDrivenSmoke`
- compile validation uses `save=false`
- durable asset creation is not allowed
- generated assets must be deleted after validation unless a smoke debug flag
  explicitly keeps them

The current durable executor boundary is:

- durable executor enabled: `false`
- durable authoring eligible: `false`
- save allowed: `false`
- package path allowlist record: `/Game/Blueprints`, `/Game/MCPGenerated`
- required preflight: asset exists check, target path allowlist, overwrite or
  rename decision, save gate review
- rollback boundary: deletion or draft retention requires an explicit policy

If a planner-safe request asks to save or create a durable asset, such as a
Blueprint named `BP_PlannerDurable` under `/Game/Blueprints`, the job contract
must keep the manifest non-executable and add
`contract_durable_executor_not_enabled`. This prevents a false-safe where
temporary smoke validation accidentally becomes a durable asset write.

Enabling durable Blueprint authoring requires:

- implementing a durable executor separate from temporary smoke
- promoting the Section 37 save gate and rollback contracts into a durable
  executor gate
- adding durable overwrite/rename policy application and rollback boundary
- adding save=true validation for durable-only manifests
- proving the durable executor through offline tests while live smoke continues
  to avoid real durable asset creation until explicitly requested

## Section 34 Durable Preflight Dry-Run Boundary

Durable requests now carry a `durable_preflight_contract` both at the manifest
top level and inside the durable executor contract.

The current dry-run preflight boundary is:

- dry-run only: `true`
- target package path parsed from `/Game/...` request text
- target Blueprint name parsed from `named` or `called`
- target asset path composed as `<package_path>/<blueprint_name>`
- package path allowlist checked against `/Game/Blueprints` and
  `/Game/MCPGenerated`
- asset existence check required but not performed by the temporary smoke
  executor
- explicit overwrite or rename-if-exists decision required
- save gate required but not passed
- durable preflight pass: `false`

For the current sample request, the dry-run target is
`/Game/Blueprints/BP_PlannerDurable`. The request remains
`authoring_attempted=false`, has no authoring commands, and cannot be promoted
to a durable save until the future executor records an actual read-only
asset-exists result and an explicit overwrite or rename decision.

Enabling the next durable authoring step requires:

- performing the read-only target asset existence check before authoring
- carrying that result into the manifest or live gate report
- requiring an explicit overwrite or rename-if-exists policy
- keeping the temporary smoke executor unable to save durable assets

## Section 35 Durable Asset Exists Read-Only Live Check

The live smoke runner may now execute a read-only preflight check for prevented
durable requests. This is not durable authoring.

The live result boundary is:

- result schema: `section_35_durable_preflight_live_result_v1`
- command: `unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.does_asset_exist`
- target source: manifest `durable_preflight_contract.target_asset_path`
- read-only: `true`
- authoring attempted: `false`
- save or delete attempted: `false`
- asset existence check performed: `true`
- durable preflight pass: `false`

If the read-only check fails, the live smoke fails before executing temporary
safe manifests. If the check passes, the request still remains prevented unless
a later durable executor step adds explicit overwrite or rename policy, save
gate, rollback boundary, and durable validation.

## Section 36 Overwrite/Rename Decision Contract

Durable preflight now embeds an `overwrite_rename_decision_contract`.

The current decision boundary is:

- decision schema: `section_36_overwrite_rename_decision_contract_v1`
- decision values: `not_required`, `missing`, `overwrite_existing`,
  `rename_if_exists`, `conflicting_decisions`
- overwrite requested: parsed from overwrite/replace/resave language
- rename-if-exists requested: parsed from create-unique/auto-rename language
- decision conflict: true only when overwrite and rename are both requested
- overwrite allowed: `false`
- rename-if-exists allowed: `false`
- executor may resolve conflict: `false`

The contract may recognize a clear overwrite or rename request, but that
recognition is not permission to save. A missing or conflicting decision keeps
the durable request prevented; a clear decision also stays prevented until a
future durable executor adds save, rollback, and validation gates.

## Section 37 Durable Save Gate And Rollback Draft

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_save_gate_contract` and
`durable_rollback_policy_contract`, also exposed at the manifest top level and
inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The save gate boundary is:

- save gate schema: `section_37_durable_save_gate_contract_v1`
- save requested: durable request flag
- save allowed: `false`
- compile save allowed: `false`
- temporary smoke may save: `false`
- preflight pass: `false`
- blocked reasons include durable executor disabled, missing live asset-exists
  result in the manifest, missing or conflicting overwrite/rename decision,
  rollback policy not ready, and durable compile-save validation not enabled

The rollback boundary is:

- rollback schema: `section_37_durable_rollback_policy_contract_v1`
- policy mode: `draft_only`
- rollback policy ready: `false`
- rollback allowed: `false`
- delete created asset on failure/cancel: `false`
- delete existing asset allowed: `false`
- overwrite existing asset allowed: `false`
- executor-created asset marker required for future rollback
- preexisting assets must be protected

This section still does not enable durable authoring. It only makes the future
durable executor's save and rollback prerequisites explicit enough to review.

## Section 38 Durable Executor Readiness Checklist

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_executor_readiness_contract`, also exposed
at the manifest top level and inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The readiness boundary is:

- readiness schema: `section_38_durable_executor_readiness_contract_v1`
- enablement mode: `disabled`
- durable executor ready: `false`
- readiness level: `not_ready`
- target package path allowlisted must pass
- live asset-exists result must be promoted into the durable save gate
- conflict-resolution decision must be present and conflict-free
- save gate must allow save
- rollback policy must be ready
- durable compile-save validation must be enabled
- executor-created asset marker policy must be ready
- explicit durable executor enable flag must be set

The checklist is the gate that the Section 39 disabled skeleton must satisfy
before it can ever become executable. If any required check fails, durable save
execution remains unavailable even if the planner status is `safe_to_author`.

## Section 39 Disabled Durable Executor Skeleton

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_executor_skeleton_contract`, also exposed
at the manifest top level and inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The skeleton boundary is:

- skeleton schema: `section_39_durable_executor_skeleton_contract_v1`
- executor mode: `disabled_skeleton`
- executor enabled: `false`
- can execute: `false`
- command plan: empty
- authoring commands allowed: `false`
- save commands allowed: `false`
- delete commands allowed: `false`
- rename commands allowed: `false`
- allowed live command count: `0`
- required input contracts include durable preflight, save gate, rollback
  policy, and readiness contracts
- forbidden commands include create, save, delete, rename, duplicate, and
  replace-existing asset operations

The skeleton may define the future durable executor shape, but it does not
enable durable authoring. A later section must explicitly set an enable flag,
make readiness pass, add command-plan tests, and prove rollback before any live
durable save command may run.

## Section 51 Durable Authoring Enable Contract

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_enable_contract`, also exposed at the
manifest top level and inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The enable contract boundary is:

- enable schema: `section_51_durable_authoring_enable_contract_v1`
- contract scope: `offline_enable_conditions_only`
- required gates: target package allowlist, overwrite-or-rename decision,
  rollback readiness, executor-created ownership marker
- durable executor may open: `false`
- durable authoring allowed: `false`
- `save=true`, `save_asset`, `delete_asset`, and `rename_asset` allowed:
  `false`

For the default durable request, the target package allowlist gate passes
because `/Game/Blueprints` is allowlisted. The overwrite/rename, rollback
readiness, and ownership marker gates fail, so the disabled skeleton remains
closed. Even a future offline contract with every Section 51 gate satisfied
would still need a later explicit durable release before live durable authoring
could run.

## Section 52 Durable Ownership Marker Contract

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_ownership_marker_contract`, also exposed
at the manifest top level and inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The ownership marker boundary is:

- marker schema: `section_52_durable_ownership_marker_contract_v1`
- marker namespace: `unreal_mcp_durable_authoring`
- marker key: `mcp_executor_created_asset_marker`
- required marker fields include executor id, durable plan id, run id, target
  asset path, created asset path, and preflight asset-exists state
- ownership marker policy ready: `true` for a durable request with a target path
- delete without marker allowed: `false`
- delete preexisting asset allowed: `false`
- overwrite/rename preexisting asset allowed: `false`

The companion rollback delete authorization contract denies delete if the
marker is missing, malformed, points at another target, or if the preflight
asset-exists result was `true`. A valid marker can authorize a future rollback
decision at report level, but it still reports `delete_allowed_now=false` until
a later durable executor release explicitly enables live delete.

## Section 53 Durable Executor Dry-Run Plan

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_dry_run_plan_contract`, also exposed at
the manifest top level and inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The dry-run plan boundary is:

- dry-run schema: `section_53_durable_executor_dry_run_plan_v1`
- plan mode: `offline_report_only`
- dry-run plan created: `true` for durable requests with a target path
- dry-run plan valid: `true` when all plan steps have no live command
- execution command plan: empty
- live command count: `0`
- durable executor may execute: `false`
- save/delete/rename allowed: `false`

The plan is intentionally useful for review but useless for execution. It may
show the sequence a future executor would need, but it must not contain
`create_blueprint`, `save_asset`, `delete_asset`, `rename_asset`, or
`compile_and_validate_blueprint(save=true)`.

## Section 54 Durable Save Validation Simulator

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_save_validation_simulation_contract`, also
exposed at the manifest top level and inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The simulator boundary is:

- simulator schema: `section_54_durable_save_validation_simulator_v1`
- simulation evaluated: `true` for durable requests with a target path
- future save conditions satisfied: `false` until every required check passes
- save true allowed: `false`
- save asset allowed: `false`
- compile-save command allowed: `false`
- live command count: `0`

The simulator evaluates target allowlist, read-only asset-exists result
availability, overwrite/rename decision, ownership marker, rollback readiness,
dry-run plan validity, enable contract satisfaction, compile-save validation,
and explicit durable executor enable flag. It must report missing conditions
without generating a live durable save command.

## Section 55 Durable Canary Preparation Contract

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_canary_prep_contract`, also exposed at
the manifest top level and inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The canary prep boundary is:

- canary prep schema: `section_55_durable_canary_prep_contract_v1`
- canary package path: `/Game/_MCP_Temp/DurableCanary`
- canary asset path: `/Game/_MCP_Temp/DurableCanary/<BlueprintName>_Canary`
- canary prep ready: `true` only when the durable request, canary allowlist,
  ownership marker policy, and save simulation are all present
- canary live execution allowed: `false`
- general Blueprints package allowed: `false`
- save true allowed: `false`
- save asset allowed: `false`
- delete asset allowed: `false`
- cleanup requires ownership marker: `true`

The contract defines a future canary target and cleanup boundary, not a live
durable operation. Section 55 must keep the disabled durable executor closed
and must not create, save, delete, rename, overwrite, or replace any asset.

## Section 56 Durable Canary Approval Gate

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_canary_approval_gate_contract`, also
exposed at the manifest top level and inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The approval gate boundary is:

- approval record schema: `section_56_durable_canary_approval_record_v1`
- approval gate schema: `section_56_durable_canary_approval_gate_v1`
- approved operation: `canary_preflight_only`
- approval scope id: `durable_canary_prep`
- approval record present: `true`
- approval scoped to canary package: `true`
- canary approval gate passed: `true`
- canary executor may open: `false`
- canary live execution allowed: `false`
- general Blueprints package allowed: `false`
- save true allowed: `false`
- save asset allowed: `false`
- delete asset allowed: `false`
- live command count: `0`

A missing, malformed, or differently scoped approval record must keep the gate
failed. A passing Section 56 gate still does not authorize live execution; it
only makes the future canary approval dependency explicit.

## Section 57 Durable Canary Live Preflight Contract

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_canary_live_preflight_contract`, also
exposed at the manifest top level and inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The live preflight boundary is:

- canary live preflight schema:
  `section_57_durable_canary_live_preflight_contract_v1`
- canary live result schema:
  `section_57_durable_canary_live_preflight_result_v1`
- canary asset path: `/Game/_MCP_Temp/DurableCanary/<BlueprintName>_Canary`
- read-only live command: `unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.does_asset_exist`
- read-only live preflight allowed: `true`
- canary execution allowed after preflight: `false`
- authoring command allowed: `false`
- save or delete allowed: `false`
- cleanup command allowed: `false`
- live authoring/save-delete/cleanup command counts: `0`

The live smoke may record whether the canary asset already exists, but that
result is evidence only. It must not create, save, delete, cleanup, rename,
overwrite, replace, or execute a canary asset.

## Section 58 Durable Canary Recovery Matrix

Durable preflight now embeds `durable_canary_recovery_matrix_contract`, also
exposed at the manifest top level and inside `authoring_executor_contract`.

The recovery matrix boundary is:

- recovery schema: `section_58_durable_canary_recovery_matrix_v1`
- recovery matrix defined: `true`
- recovery matrix ready: `true`
- scenario count: `6`
- cleanup requires ownership marker: `true`
- cleanup requires preflight asset absent: `true`
- cleanup requires created asset path match: `true`
- cleanup/delete/save/authoring command allowed: `false`
- live cleanup/delete/save/authoring command counts: `0`

The matrix gives a future durable canary executor a checklist for failure
handling, but it is not a cleanup permission. Cleanup and delete still need a
later explicit release gate.

## Section 59 Release Boundary V2

Section 59 is owned by `bp_authoring_release_boundary_report.py`, not by live
Blueprint execution. The v2 report consolidates Section 51-58 contract status
and records that durable authoring remains disabled. Job manifests continue to
carry the Section 51-58 contracts, but Section 59 does not add any authoring,
save, delete, cleanup, or canary execution command.

## Live Smoke Rule

The planner-driven live smoke must execute the manifest, not the raw user
request and not only the planner label. Live temporary Blueprint assets remain
limited to `/Game/_MCP_Temp/PlannerDrivenSmoke`, unless a caller supplies an
explicit temporary package path for a smoke run.

## Refusal Boundary

A non-safe request must not contain `create_blueprint`, component, variable,
graph, dispatcher, or save commands. It may only record reasons, missing
specificity, and required reinforcement.

A planner-safe request with missing concrete executor details, such as an
unspecified component type, variable metadata, graph topology, or UFunction,
must also remain dry-run until those details are explicit.

A planner-safe request with a non-allowlisted parent class must also remain
dry-run until the parent class receives Section 31 reinforcement.

A planner-safe request that asks for a saved or durable asset must also remain
dry-run until Section 51 durable enable gates, Section 52 ownership marker
policy, Section 53 dry-run plan, Section 54 save simulator, Section 55 canary
prep, Section 56 canary approval gate, Section 57 canary live preflight, and a
Section 58 canary recovery matrix, plus a later durable executor release are all
proven. A read-only
asset-exists result, parsed overwrite/rename decision, draft save gate,
readiness checklist entry, disabled durable executor skeleton, or ownership
marker/dry-run/save-simulation/canary-prep/canary-approval/canary-preflight
or recovery contract alone must not enable durable save, delete, cleanup,
rename, overwrite, replacement behavior, or live canary execution.

## Validation

Executable manifests must compile with `compile_error_count=0`, re-read graph
or node state, pass structural postconditions, and clean up generated temporary
assets unless the caller explicitly keeps smoke assets.

Live reports must include validation diagnostics such as manifest step count,
node count, graph count, structural assertion count, dataflow verification,
compile result, and cleanup result.
