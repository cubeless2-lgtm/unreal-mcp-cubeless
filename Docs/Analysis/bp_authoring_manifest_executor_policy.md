# BP Authoring Manifest Executor Policy

This policy defines the Section 40 execution layer between a structured
Blueprint authoring manifest and live UnrealMCP commands.

## Required Flow

1. A user request must first pass through the planner and Section 12-39 job
   manifest contract.
2. The live runner must build a Section 40 executor policy for every manifest.
3. Only manifests with `can_execute=true` may reach temporary live authoring.
4. The executor is temporary-scope only: output must stay under
   `/Game/_MCP_Temp`.
5. Durable authoring, save, overwrite, rename, and delete behavior remains
   disabled.
6. The executor report must expose its version, command plan, blocked reasons,
   section results, structural validation results, and failure diagnostics.
7. Failure diagnostics must use the Section 41 category/replay-safety schema
   before a failed run is considered reviewable.
8. Section 42-45 capability coverage must report whether typed defaults, graph
   layout/dataflow, function graph execution, and dispatcher lifecycle execution
   have the required validation evidence.
9. Section 46-48 durable gate coverage must prove durable requests are limited
   to read-only live preflight and expose zero save/delete/rename/authoring
   command allowance.
10. Section 51 durable enable coverage must prove target allowlist,
    overwrite/rename decision, rollback readiness, and ownership marker gates
    stay separated and do not open durable executor execution.
11. Section 52 ownership marker coverage must prove delete without marker and
    preexisting asset delete/overwrite/rename remain forbidden.
12. Section 53 dry-run plan coverage must prove durable plans contain no live
    execution commands and cannot execute.
13. Section 54 save simulator coverage must prove save prerequisites can be
    evaluated without allowing `save=true`, `save_asset`, or live commands.
14. Section 55 canary prep coverage must prove the canary target is limited to
    `/Game/_MCP_Temp/DurableCanary` and still allows no live canary, save, or
    delete commands.
15. Section 56 canary approval coverage must prove approval is explicit and
    scoped while still allowing no executor-open, live canary, save, or delete
    commands.
16. Section 57 canary live preflight coverage must prove the only live canary
    operation is read-only asset-exists and still allows no canary execution,
    save, delete, or cleanup commands.
17. Section 58 recovery matrix coverage must prove recovery scenarios are
    defined while cleanup, delete, save, and authoring commands remain disabled.
18. Section 59 release boundary v2 coverage must consolidate Section 51-58 as
    blocking-safe while still reporting durable authoring disabled.

## Execution Boundary

The Section 40 executor may run only planner-safe, executable, Actor-parent
temporary manifests. It must block:

- non-safe manifests
- non-executable manifests
- durable authoring requests
- parent classes outside the current allowlist
- temporary package paths outside `/Game/_MCP_Temp`
- unknown live commands
- save/delete/rename commands
- any compile request with `save=true`
- any durable gate that unexpectedly enables saved asset authoring, save,
  delete, rename, overwrite, or replacement behavior
- any Section 51 enable contract that reports `durable_executor_may_open=true`
- any ownership marker contract that allows delete without marker or delete of
  a preexisting asset
- any Section 53 dry-run plan with a non-empty execution command plan or live
  command count
- any Section 54 simulator that allows `save=true`, `save_asset`, compile-save,
  or live command execution
- any Section 55 canary prep contract that allows live canary execution,
  general `/Game/Blueprints` output, `save=true`, `save_asset`, or `delete_asset`
- any Section 56 canary approval gate that allows executor open, live canary
  execution, general `/Game/Blueprints` output, `save=true`, `save_asset`,
  `delete_asset`, or any live command
- any Section 57 canary live preflight contract that allows canary execution,
  authoring, save/delete, cleanup, or any non-read-only live command
- any Section 58 canary recovery matrix that allows cleanup, delete, save,
  authoring, or any live cleanup/delete/save/authoring command

## Validation

- Offline tests must prove the executor policy count: 12 executable temporary
  manifests and 7 blocked manifests for the default request set.
- Offline tests must prove the durable gate count: 1 durable requested manifest,
  1 read-only live preflight allowed manifest, and 0 durable executor/save/delete
  command allowance.
- Offline tests must prove the Section 51 enable contract count: 1 durable
  requested manifest, 0 enable-contract-satisfied manifests, 0 durable executor
  may-open manifests, 0 forbidden command allowance, and independent gate counts
  for target allowlist, overwrite/rename, rollback readiness, and ownership
  marker.
- Offline tests must prove the Section 52 ownership marker count: 1 durable
  marker request, 1 marker policy ready request, 0 delete-without-marker
  allowance, and 0 preexisting asset delete allowance.
- Offline tests must prove the Section 53 dry-run plan count: 1 durable plan
  created, 1 valid no-command plan, 0 executor may-execute plans, and 0 live
  commands.
- Offline tests must prove the Section 54 simulator count: 1 simulation
  evaluated, 0 future-save-ready simulations, 0 save=true allowance, 0
  save_asset allowance, 0 compile-save command allowance, and 0 live commands.
- Offline tests must prove the Section 55 canary prep count: 1 canary prep
  ready contract, 0 live canary allowance, 0 general Blueprints package
  allowance, 0 save=true allowance, 0 save_asset allowance, and 0 delete_asset
  allowance.
- Offline tests must prove the Section 56 canary approval count: 1 approval
  record, 1 approval gate pass, 1 canary package scope match, 0 executor-open
  allowance, 0 live canary allowance, 0 save/delete allowance, and 0 live
  commands.
- Offline tests must prove the Section 57 canary live preflight count: 1
  read-only canary preflight allowance, 0 canary execution allowance, 0
  authoring command allowance, 0 save/delete allowance, 0 cleanup allowance, and
  0 live authoring/save/delete/cleanup command counts.
- Offline tests must prove the Section 58 recovery matrix count: 1 ready
  recovery matrix, 6 recovery scenarios, 0 cleanup/delete/save/authoring
  allowance, and 0 live cleanup/delete/save/authoring command counts.
- Offline tests must prove the Section 59 release boundary v2 row reports
  Section 51-58 blocking contracts ready and durable authoring still disabled.
- The planner-driven live smoke must report the executor version and executor
  executable count.
- The planner-driven live smoke may perform only the read-only durable
  asset-exists preflight and must report that no durable authoring or
  save/delete command was attempted.
- The live smoke still owns the Unreal bridge adapter, cleanup, and temp asset
  inspection, but section orchestration must go through
  `bp_authoring_manifest_executor.py`.
- Generated assets must be deleted unless explicitly kept for debugging.

## Decision

Section 40 does not enable durable asset authoring. It only makes temporary safe
manifest execution explicit, inspectable, and reusable before later durable
gates are considered.
